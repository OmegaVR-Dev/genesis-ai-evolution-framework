## Context Restoration Instructions

### For New Chat Sessions
When VS Code chat becomes slow, save this file and start a new chat with:

```
"Read conversation_log.md and conversation_state.json in my project folder to understand our [PROJECT_NAME] development progress"
```

### Key Context Points

## Template Usage Instructions

1. **Copy this template** for your project
2. **Fill in project-specific details** in brackets
3. **Update regularly** as development progresses
4. **Use as chat restoration point** when VS Code becomes slow
5. **Share sanitized versions** to help other developers

## Why This Works

This persistence system:
- **Eliminates VS Code chat memory bloat**
- **Preserves development context across sessions**
- **Enables continuous long-term development**
- **Works around tool limitations elegantly**
- **Scales to projects of any size**

*Remember: Work around tool limitations rather than fighting them!*
