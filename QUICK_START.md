# VS Code Chat Performance Fix: Quick Start Guide:
---

## ðŸš¨ The Problem
VS Code chat becomes painfully slow (10-30+ second responses) during long development sessions, forcing you to lose context when starting new chats.

## âš¡ The Solution
Create local persistence files that maintain full project context, allowing instant recovery in fresh chat windows.

### Step 1: When Chat Gets Slow
1. **Update your state files** with current progress
2. **Start new VS Code chat window**
3. **First message**: "Read conversation_log.md and conversation_state.json in my project folder to understand our [PROJECT] development progress"
4. **Continue development** with full context restored instantly!

## ðŸ“Š Results
- **Before**: 30-second chat responses, lost context
- **After**: Instant responses, perfect context continuity
- **Bonus**: Natural project documentation and backup

## ðŸŽ¯ Real Example
This solution was battle-tested during development of a therapeutic vaporwave visualizer with:
- 200+ video files and complex WebGL shaders
- Hours of conversation history causing severe lag
- Perfect context restoration across multiple chat sessions

## ðŸš€ Share Your Success
If this saves your productivity, please share it! Other developers are suffering from the same VS Code chat performance issues.

**The Philosophy**: Work around tool limitations rather than fighting them.

*Just like we bypass CORS errors with local files, we bypass VS Code memory limits with local state files.*
